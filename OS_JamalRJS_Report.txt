Explain the problem in terms of operating system concept (200 w max)
  Question no : 8
  Description :- In this problem we got processes in round robin method , given arrived time , Priority values
                        based on these both process should proceed further in CPU scheduling takes place . Quantum
                        time is 2 , after the process completes one quntum it checks priority at that time of arrival 
                        and then proceeds further . After complection of process it terminates . Program calculates 
                        Waiting Time (WT), Turn Around Time(TAT) , Priority ,  Arrival Time (AT).
  Question no : 19
  Description :-  In the given problem of 10 students are purchasing the gift and returning to gift counter.The accountant
                       gives the preference to that student who has maximum number of gifts. If we talk about this problem in 
                       Operating System concept, In priority scheduling algorithm, a priority is associated with each process and 
                       CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority. If two processes have with each process and 
                       with each process and  will be execute in first come first serve order.

2. Write the algorithm for proposed solution of the assigned problem.
Problem 1 doesn’t require any algorithm to implement.
I have used Bubble Sort algorithm in Problem 2 to sort the processes in descending order based on the
arrival time of processes and updated there priority and sorted the order of process based on there
current priority


3. Calculate complexity of implemented algorithm. (Student must specify complexity of
each line of code along with overall complexity)


Step 1: Compare the first and the second element of the list and swap
them if they are in wrong order. O(n)
Step 2: Compare the second and the third element of the list and swap
them if they are in wrong order.
O(n)
Step 3: Proceed till the last element of the list in a similar fashion.
Step 4: Repeat all of the above steps until the list is sorted.
The complexity of bubble sort is O(n2
) in both worst and average cases,
because the entire array needs to be iterated for every element



4. Explain all the constraints given in the problem. Attach the code snippet of the
implemented constraint.
PROBLEM 1: For  no snippet

Problem 2: In this problems, we are given constraint of 10 students. Whereas I applied a constraint of
gifts a student can purchase, i.e. 1 <= gift <50
This implies that one has to buy at least 1 gift or no student can buy more than 49 gifts.



5. If you have implemented any additional algorithm to support the solution, explain the
need and usage of the same.
(Bubble Sort)
Bubble sort is (provably) the fastest sort available under a very specific circumstance. It originally
became well known primarily because it was one of the first algorithms (of any kind) that was
rigorously analyzed, and the proof was found that it was optimal under its limited circumstance.


1. begin BubbleSort(list)
2. for all elements of list
3. if list[i] > list[i+1]
4. swap(list[i], list[i+1])
5. end if
6. end for
7. return list
8.end BubbleSort



6. Explain the boundary conditions of the  implemented code
There are no boundary conditions for given problems.




7. Explain all the test cases applied on the solution of assigned problem.
                Problem 1: This problem doesn’t require any additional test case.
                 We’ll get a different output everytime when we execute the code of this problem.
                 The screenshots of output are attached below.
